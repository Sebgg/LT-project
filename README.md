    1    Complete fail        Words didnt translate or meaning changed <br>
    2    Bad translation    Meaning is just legible <br>
    3    Okay-ish translation    Everything is technically correct, just doesnâ€™t feel right, very minor mistakes <br>
    4    Good translation    Not exactly perfect, but it's good <br>
    5    Perfect translation    Creme de la creme, A+, How Ruben would have done it <br>
